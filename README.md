# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze weather data in order to determine if a combination surf/ice cream shop would be a profitable business venture, as opening one in an area where it rains too much can cause it to fail (which is what happened to our main investor). In this updated analysis, we specifically focused on gathering summary statistics for temparatures from June and December as reflected on the "hawaii.sqlite" file. 

## Results
The main differences between June and December statistics are as follows. 
* The mean temperature wasn't too far off, with June having a mean of 74.94 (rounded to two decimal places), and December having a mean of 71.04.
* The min temperature had a greater variation, with December having a min of 56, and June having a min of 64. 
* The max temperatures, like the mean, weren't too far off, with June having a max of 85, and December having a max of 83.

## Summary
Overall it appears that the temperatures between June and December don't seem to vary too much, meaning that this surf and ice cream shop could have a decent chance of performing well throughout the year. Two additional queries that could be performed would be to gather precipitation data from June and December, respecitvely, which reveals that although the average isn't too high, it is slightly higher in December than in June, so one would need to be congnizant that December would be the "wet season" for the locale that this shop would potentially be opening in.
